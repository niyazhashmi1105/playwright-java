**Project Directory Structure:**
.github: A folder for GitHub configurations, typically used for actions or workflows.
playwright-java: Core project directory for Playwright testing in Java.
reports: Contains test reports, including index.html which might be used for viewing test execution reports.
screenshots: Likely stores screenshot captures from test executions.
src: This is typically where the source code of the project resides.
target: Contains compiled files and test outputs generated during the build phase.
docker-compose.yml & Dockerfile: Docker configurations for containerizing the project, indicating potential CI/CD integration.
Jenkinsfile: Specifies the CI/CD pipeline configuration for Jenkins.
pom.xml: The Maven Project Object Model (POM) file, managing dependencies and build configurations.
test-results-summary.txt: A summary of test results, likely an output of the testing framework.
testng.xml: TestNG configuration file, defining the suite of tests to run.

**Description:**
The folder structure above represents a Playwright-based testing framework in Java with Maven as the build tool. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

_Reports and Logging_: The reports folder holds the test results, such as the HTML file (index.html), for reviewing the test execution status in the browser.
_Source Code and Screenshots_: The src folder stores the source code for your tests, while screenshots holds images captured during test runs.
_Configuration for CI/CD_: Files like Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml suggest the project is set up for CI/CD pipelines, running tests in a containerized environment.
_Test Execution_: testng.xml and test-results-summary.txt are key for test configurations and tracking the results.
